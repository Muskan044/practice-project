        <h1 id="top">Project : Development of weather prediction application </h1>
        <video src="../video/weatherPredict.mp4" controls loop width="400" poster="../images/weather.png"></video>
        <p>Weather forecasting uses data from satellites and radars to predict the weather. It is important because a variety of industries and everyday activities rely on accurate weather forecasting. For example, agriculture relies on weather forecasting to predict the best times for planting, growing, and harvesting crops. Weather forecasts have a high degree of reliability for shorter periods of time. For example, studies show that weather forecasts have a 90% accuracy for five-day forecasts and an 80% accuracy for a seven-day forecast. However, as the time period extends beyond ten days, the accuracy drops below 50%. This is due to the diverse factors that influence the weather, as well as the unpredictability of atmospheric conditions generating these weather patterns.</p>
        <h1>Project : Fraud Application Dedector Software</h1>
        <video src="../video/fraudPredict.mp4" controls loop width="400" poster="../images/dedector.png"></video>
        <p>Fraud detection software is designed to automatically stop online fraud. The software analyses online user actions and, based on your risk rules, blocks those that are deemed high risk. A high-risk user action can be a payment, signup, or login, among others. A high-risk user action can be a payment, signup, or login, among others. The fraud detection software must be setup to analyse user or payment data, analyse that data via risk rules, and decide if it is risky or not. Fraud detection software is often deployed to prevent payment fraud and chargebacks, identity fraud, and account takeover fraud, and a key advantage is that it can run automatically with little to no human oversight.</p>
        <h1>Project : Stock price predictor application </h1>
        <video src="../video/stockPredict.mp4"  controls loop width="400" poster="../images/stock.png"></video>
        <p>A stock market is a public market where you can buy and sell shares for publicly listed companies. The stocks, also known as equities, represent ownership in the company. The stock exchange is the mediator that allows the buying and selling of shares. Stock Price Prediction using machine learning helps you discover the future value of company stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. The entire idea of predicting stock prices is to gain significant profits. Predicting how the stock market will perform is a hard task to do. There are other factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make share prices dynamic and volatile. This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy. </p>
